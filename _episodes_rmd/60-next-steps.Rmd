```

Data in bioinformatics is often complex. 
To deal with this, developers define specialised
data containers (termed classes) that match the properties of the
data they need to handle.

This aspect is central to the **Bioconductor**[^Bioconductor] project which 
uses the same **core data infrastructure** across packages. This certainly contributed 
to Bioconductor's success. Bioconductor package developers are advised to make 
use of existing infrastructure to provide coherence, interoperability and stability to
the project as a whole.

[^Bioconductor]:The [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) was initiated by Robert Gentleman, one of the two creators of the R language. Bioconductor provides  tools dedicated to omics data analysis. Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is open source and open development. 


To illustrate such an omics data container, we'll present the `SummarizedExperiment`
class.

## SummarizedExperiment

The figure below represents the anatomy of SummarizedExperiment.

```{r SE,  echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/SE.png")
```


Objects of the class SummarizedExperiment contain :

- **One (or more) assay(s)** containing the quantitative omics data
  (expression data), stored as a matrix-like object. Features (genes,
  transcripts, proteins, ...) are defined along the rows and samples
  along the columns.

- A **sample metadata** slot containing sample co-variates, stored as a
  data frame. Rows from this table represent samples (rows match exactly the 
  columns of the expression data). 

- A **feature metadata** slot containing feature co-variates, stored as
  data frame. The rows of this dataframe's match exactly the rows of the 
  expression data. 
  
The coordinated nature of the SummarizedExperiment guarantees that 
during data manipulation, the
dimensions of the different slots will always match (i.e the columns
in the expression data and then rows in the sample metadata, as well
as the rows in the expression data and feature metadata) during data
manipulation. For example, if we had to exclude one sample from the assay,
it would be automatically removed from the sample metadata in the same operation.

The metadata slots can grow additional co-variates
(columns) without affecting the other structures.



### Creating a SummarizedExperiment

```{r , echo = F, message = FALSE}
rna <- read_csv("data/rnaseq.csv")
counts <- rna %>%
  select(gene, sample, expression) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression) 

count_matrix <- counts %>% select(-gene) %>% as.matrix()
rownames(count_matrix) <- counts$gene


sample_metadata <- rna %>%
  select(sample, organism, age, sex, infection, strain, time, tissue, mouse) 

sample_metadata <- unique(sample_metadata)

gene_metadata <- rna %>%
  select(gene, ENTREZID, product, ensembl_gene_id, external_synonym, chromosome_name, gene_biotype, phenotype_description, hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name)      

# Remove redundancy
gene_metadata <- unique(gene_metadata)

```

Remember the `rna` dataset that we have used previously.

From this table we have already created 3 different tables.

- **An expression matrix**

```{r}
count_matrix[1:5, ]
dim(count_matrix)
```


- **A table describing the samples**

```{r}
sample_metadata
```

- **A table describing the genes**

```{r}
gene_metadata
```

We will create a `SummarizedExperiment` from these tables:

- The count matrix that will be used as the **`assay`**

- The table describing the samples will be used as the **sample metadata** slot

- The table describing the genes will be used as the **features metadata** slot

To do this we can put the different parts together using the
`SummarizedExperiment` constructor:

```{r, message = FALSE}
#BiocManager::install("SummarizedExperiment")
library("SummarizedExperiment")
```

```{r}
se <- SummarizedExperiment(assays = count_matrix,
                           colData = sample_metadata,
                           rowData = gene_metadata)
se
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
save(se, file = "data/SE.rda")
```

Using this data structure, we can access the expression matrix with
the `assay` function: 


```{r}
head(assay(se))
dim(assay(se))
```

We can access the sample metadata using the `colData` function:

```{r}
colData(se)
dim(colData(se))
```

We can also access the feature metadata using the `rowData` function:

```{r}
head(rowData(se))
dim(rowData(se))
```


### Subsetting a SummarizedExperiment

SummarizedExperiment can be subset just like with data frames, 
with numerics or with characters of logicals.

Below, we create a new instance of class SummarizedExperiment that contains only 
the 5 first features for the 3 first samples.

```{r}
se1 <- se[1:5, 1:3]
se1
```

```{r}
colData(se1)
rowData(se1)
```


We can also use the `colData()` function to subset on something from the sample metadata, or the `rowData()` to subset on something from the feature metadata.
For example, here we keep only miRNAs and the non infected samples:

```{r}
se1 <- se[rowData(se)$gene_biotype == "miRNA", 
          colData(se)$infection == "NonInfected"]
se1
assay(se1)
colData(se1)
rowData(se1)
```




For the following exercise, you should download the SE.rda object 
(that contains the `se` object), and open the file using the 
'load()' function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/bioinfo-training-01-intro-r/master/data/SE.rda", 
              destfile = "data/SE.rda")

load(file = "data/SE.rda")
```

> ## Challenge
> 
> Extract the gene expression levels of the 3 first genes in samples at time 0 and at time 8.
> 
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > 
> > ```{r, purl=FALSE}
> > assay(se)[1:3, colData(se)$time != 4]
> > 
> > # Equivalent to
> > assay(se)[1:3, colData(se)$time == 0 | colData(se)$time == 8]
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

#### Adding variables to metadata

We can also add information to the metadata.
Suppose that you want to add the center where the samples were collected...

```{r}
colData(se)$center <- rep("University of Illinois", nrow(colData(se)))
colData(se)
```

This illustrates that the metadata slots can grow indefinitely without affecting 
the other structures!



**Take-home message**


- `SummarizedExperiment` represent an efficient way to store and to handle omics data.

- They are used in many Bioconductor packages. 

If you follow next training focused on RNA sequencing analysis, you will learn to 
use the Bioconductor `DESeq2` package to do some differential expression analyses. 
`DESeq2`'s whole analysis is handled in a `SummarizedExperiment`.
