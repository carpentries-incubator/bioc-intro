## Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to
read, especially for complicated operations. 

Some packages can greatly facilitate our task when we manipulate data.
Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you
do more stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or
`data.frame()`, come built into R; Loading packages can give you access to other
specific functions. Before you use a package for the first time you need to install
it on your machine, and then you should import it in every subsequent
R session when you need it. 

- The package **`dplyr`** provides powerful tools for data manipulation tasks. 
It is built to work directly with data frames, with many manipulation tasks
optimized.

- As we will see latter on, sometimes we want a data frame to be reshaped to be able 
to do some specific analyses or for visualization. The package **`tidyr`** addresses
this common problem of reshaping data and provides tools for manipulating 
data in a tidy way.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** after the workshop,
you may want to check out this [handy data transformation with
**`dplyr`**
cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
and this [one about
**`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

- The **`tidyverse`** package is an "umbrella-package" that installs
several useful packages for data analysis which work well together,
such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.
These packages help us to work and interact with the data. 
They allow us to do many things with your data, such as subsetting, transforming, 
visualizing, etc.

To install and load the **`tidyverse`** package type:

```{r eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("tidyverse")
```

```{r, message = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library("tidyverse")
```


## Loading data with tidyverse

Instead of `read.csv()`, we will read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the
tidyverse package **`readr`**, .


```{r, message = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
rna <- read_csv("data/rnaseq.csv")

## view the data
rna
```

Notice that the class of the data is now referred to as a "tibble". 

Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the data frame objects we introduced in the 
previously. The data structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes 
the only differences are that:

1. It displays the data type of each column under its name.
Note that <`dbl`> is a data type defined to hold numeric values with 
decimal points. 

2. It only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on 
one screen. 
   
We are now going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument
to this function is the data frame (`rna`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
select(rna, gene, sample, tissue, expression)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
select(rna, -tissue, -organism)
```

This will select all the variables in `rna` except `tissue`
and `organism`.

To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
filter(rna, sex == "Male")
filter(rna, sex == "Male" & infection == "NonInfected")
```

Now let's imagine we are interested in the human homologs of the mouse 
genes analysed in this dataset. This information can be found in the 
last column of the `rna` tibble, named `hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name`.
Some mouse gene have no human homologs. These can be retrieved using a `filter()` 
in the chain, and the `is.na()` function that determines whether something is an `NA`.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_NA <- filter(rna, is.na(hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name))
select(rna_NA, gene, hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name)
```

If we want to keep only mouse gene that have a human homolog, we can insert a "!"
symbol that negates the result, so we're asking for every row where 
hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name *is not* an `NA`.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_no_NA <- filter(rna, !is.na(hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name))
select(rna_no_NA, gene, hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name)
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna2 <- filter(rna, sex == "Male")
rna3 <- select(rna2, gene, sample, tissue, expression)
rna3
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of intermediate objects 
that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna3 <- select(filter(rna, sex == "Male"), gene, sample, tissue, expression)
rna3
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as
R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful
when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  

Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, 
installed automatically with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `rna` dataset first through
`filter()` to keep rows where `sex` is Male, then through `select()`
to keep only the `gene`, `sample`, `tissue`, and `expression`columns. 

The pipe `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it directly as the first 
argument to the function on its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame 
as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male") %>% 
  select(gene, sample, tissue, expression)
```


Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance,
in the above example, we took the data frame `rna`, *then* we `filter`ed
for rows with `sex == "Male"`, *then* we `select`ed columns `gene`, `sample`, 
`tissue`, and `expression`. 

The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat 
simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish
more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we
can assign it a new name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna3 <- rna %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male") %>% 
  select(gene, sample, tissue, expression)

rna3
```

## Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values of existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of time in hours:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%  
  mutate(time_hours = time * 24) %>% 
  select(time, time_hours) 
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%  
  mutate(time_hours = time * 24, 
         time_mn = time_hours * 60) %>% 
  select(time, time_hours, time_mn) 
```

## Split-apply-combine data analysis

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the
*split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some
analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`**
makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene)
```

The `group_by()` function doesn't perform any data processing, it
groups the data into subsets: in the example above, our initial
`tibble` of `r nrow(rna)` observations is split into
`r length(unique(rna$gene))` groups based on the `gene` variable.


We could similarly decide to group the tibble by the samples:

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(sample)
```

Here our initial `tibble` of `r nrow(rna)` observations is split into
`r length(unique(rna$sample))` groups based on the `sample` variable.

Once the data have been combined, subsequent operations will be
applied on each group independently.


### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which
collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group.

`group_by()` takes as arguments the column names that contain the
**categorical** variables for which you want to calculate the summary
statistics. So to compute the mean `expression` by gene:

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression))
```

We could also want to calculate the mean expression levels of all genes in each sample:

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(sample) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression))
```

But we can can also group by multiple columns:

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene, infection, time) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression))
```

Once the data is grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a 
column indicating the median `expression` by gene and by condition:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene, infection, time) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression),
            median_expression = median(expression)) 
```

> >   filter(gene == "Dok3") %>% 
> >   group_by(time) %>% 
> >   summarize(mean = mean(expression)) 
> > ```
> > {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found
for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides
`count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for
each infected and non infected samples, we would do:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
    count(infection)
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `rna %>% count()` is equivalent to:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
    group_by(infection) %>% 
    summarise(n = n())
```


Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of rows/observations
for *one* factor (i.e., `infection`).
If we wanted to count *combination of factors*, such as `infection` and `time`,
we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

```{r purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
    count(infection, time)
```

which is equivalent to this:

```{r purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  group_by(infection, time) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
```

It is sometimes useful to sort the result to facilitate the comparisons. 
We can use `arrange()` to sort the table.
For instance, we might want to arrange the table above by time:

```{r purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  count(infection, time) %>%
  arrange(time)
```

or by counts:

```{r purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  count(infection, time) %>%
  arrange(n)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  count(infection, time) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

## Reshaping data

In the `rna` tibble, the rows contain expression values (the unit) that are
associated with a combination of 2 other variables: `gene` and `sample`.

All the other columns correspond to variables describing either
the sample (organism, age, sex,...) or the gene (gene_biotype, ENTREZ_ID, product...).
The variables that don’t change with genes or with samples will have the same value in all the rows.

   
```{r}
rna %>%
  arrange(gene) 
```  



This structure is called a `long-format`, as one column contains all the values,
and other column(s) list(s) the context of the value.

In certain cases, the `long-format` is not really "human-readable", and another format,
a `wide-format` is preferred, as a more compact way of representing the data.
This is typically the case with gene expression values that scientists are used to
look as matrices, were rows represent genes and columns represent samples.

In this format, it would become therefore straightforward 
to explore the relationship between the gene expression levels within, and
between, the samples. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
rna %>% 
  select(gene, sample, expression) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression)
```  

To convert the gene expression values from `rna` into a wide-format,
we need to create a new table where the values of the `sample` column would 
become the names of column variables. 

The key point here is that we are still following
a tidy data structure, but we have **reshaped** the data according to
the observations of interest: expression levels per gene instead
of recording them per gene and per sample.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into
values of a new variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions,
`pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` (see
[here](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html) for
details).

### Pivoting the data into a wider format

Let's first select the 3 first columns of `rna` and use `pivot_wider()` 
to transform data in a wide-format.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_exp <- rna %>% 
  select(gene, sample, expression)
rna_exp
```

`pivot_wider` takes three main arguments:

1. the data to be transformed;
2. the `names_from` : the column whose values will become new column
   names;
3. the `values_from`: the column whose values will fill the new
   columns.

![](./figs/pivot_wider.png)

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_wide <- rna_exp %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression)
rna_wide
```


Note that by default, the `pivot_wider()` function will add `NA` for missing values.

Let's imagine that for some reason, we had some missing expression values for some 
genes in certain samples. In the following fictive example, the gene Cyp2d22 has only
one expression value, in GSM2545338 sample.


```{r, purl = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
rna_with_missing_values <- rna %>% 
  select(gene, sample, expression) %>% 
  filter(gene %in% c("Asl", "Apod", "Cyp2d22")) %>% 
  filter(sample %in% c("GSM2545336", "GSM2545337", "GSM2545338")) %>% 
  arrange(sample) %>% 
  filter(!(gene == "Cyp2d22" & sample != "GSM2545338"))
```

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_with_missing_values
```

By default, the `pivot_wider()` function will add `NA` for missing values.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_with_missing_values %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression)
```


### Pivoting data into a longer format

In the opposite situation we are using the column names and turning them into
a pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names as
values, and the other variable contains the values previously
associated with the column names.

`pivot_longer()` takes four main arguments:

1. the data to be transformed;
2. the `names_to`: the new column name we wish to create and populate with the
   current column names;
3. the `values_to`: the new column name we wish to create and populate with
   current values;
4. the names of the columns to be used to populate the `names_to` and
   `values_to` variables (or to drop).
   
![](./figs/pivot_longer.png)   

To recreate `rna_long` from `rna_long` we would create a key
called `sample` and value called `expression` and use all columns
except `gene` for the key variable. Here we drop `gene` column
with a minus sign.

Notice how the new variable names are to be quoted here. 

```{r}
rna_long <- rna_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(names_to = "sample",
                 values_to = "expression",
                 -gene)
rna_long
```


We could also have used a specification for what columns to
include. This can be useful if you have a large number of identifying
columns, and it's easier to specify what to gather than what to leave
alone. Here the `starts_with()` function can help to retrieve sample
names without having to list them all!
Another possibility would be to use the `:` operator!

```{r}
rna_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(names_to = "sample",
                 values_to = "expression",
                 cols = starts_with("GSM"))
rna_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(names_to = "sample",
                 values_to = "expression",
                 GSM2545336:GSM2545380)
```



Note that if we had missing values in the wide-format, the `NA` would be 
included in the new long format. 

Remember our previous fictive tibble containing missing values:

```{r}
rna_with_missing_values

wide_with_NA <- rna_with_missing_values %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression)
wide_with_NA

wide_with_NA %>%
    pivot_longer(names_to = "sample",
                 values_to = "expression",
                 -gene)
```

Pivoting to wider and longer formats can be a useful way to balance out a dataset 
so every replicate has the same composition.

## Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use `dplyr` to extract information from
or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share
them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data_output`,
in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want 
to write generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. 
It's good practice to keep them separate. The `data` folder should only contain 
the raw, unaltered data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete 
or modify it. In contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data_output`
directory, so even if the files it contains are deleted, we can always
re-generate them.

Let's use `write_csv()` to save the rna_wide table that we have created previously.


```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(rna_wide, file = "data_output/rna_wide.csv")
```
